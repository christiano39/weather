# Weather App

This app is a small side project created by Christian Arneson.

## Usage

This app uses your current geolocation to display the current weather in your area using the [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/) API. Users can also use the search bar to display weather in any city.

## Tech

This app is currently a static front-end app, which uses React and MaterialUI.

## Upcoming updates

- convert state management to either Redux or Context
- create a back-end using Node and Express, so that users can log in and save their dashboard of various cities
